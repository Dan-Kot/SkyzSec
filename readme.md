Learning Computer Science
============================
This is hard and will take a long time - I'm not talented at programming, I'm actually not good at it but am doing it for the challenge.

My weak area is I spend alot of time researching knowledge online and not coding and neglected math in high school. So now I need to spend more time coding and more time with math.


===============================
Possible Quick Win - CCNA
===============================
I completed NexGenT's Cybersecurity program last year and now I'm doing their Network Engineering program - maybe I'll land a job in IT this year by completing this program.
